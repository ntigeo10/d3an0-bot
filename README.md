# D3AN0 Bot
Version 0.0.1

An interactive bot that I made for my Discord server! More features will be added in the future! It uses discord.py! 
A list of detailed imports will be added in later time.

If you wish to use the bot as it is, make sure to make a .env file and add the required fields!

Currently, it has 2 sections of commands.

Bot's prefix is "!" but will be changed in future updates (Command will be included so that people with permissions can change it)

# RSS Feed parser
!setrss -> Specific roles can set a channel as the one that the bot will send RSS Feed in.

!pauserss -> Specific roles can stop the bot from sending RSS Feed

!resumerss -> Specific roles can resume bot's RSS Feed parsing. 

# Joke commands

!dadjoke -> Fetches the 50 most rated Reddit posts from DadJoke subreddit and posts one of them as an embed.
