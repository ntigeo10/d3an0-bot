# D3AN0 Bot
Version 0.0.1

An interactive bot that I made for my Discord server! More features will be added in the future! It uses discord.py! 

Currently, it has 2 sections of commands.

Bot's prefix is "!" but will be changed in future updates (Command will be included so that people with permissions can change it)

# RSS Feed parser
!setrss -> Specific roles can set a channel as the one that the bot will send RSS Feed in.
!pauserss -> Specific roles can stop the bot from sending RSS Feed
!resumerss -> Specific roles can resume bot's RSS Feed parsing. 

# Joke commands
!programmingjoke -> Fetches the 50 most rated Reddit posts from ProgrammingJoke subreddit and posts one of them as an embed. 
!dadjoke -> Fetches the 50 most rated Reddit posts from DadJoke subreddit and posts one of them as an embed. 


# Soon to be added! 

!help command and Marvel related commands (Due to an error I have to rewrite the cog once again!)
